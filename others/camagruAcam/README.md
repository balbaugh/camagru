# Camagru

### For this project I used **PHP** for the back-end part and **HTML**, **CSS**, **Javascript** for the front-end and **MySql** for the database part. 

Camagru is the first school project from the web development branch. It is a small Instagram-like website that enables users to make and share photo edits.
For this school project, the usage of frameworks was forbidden, so everything had to be done manually.

A small sneak peek:

Basic functionalities are implemented:
1. New user creation:

After the "Submit" button was pressed, if every field was filled accordingly, an account activation e-mail will be sent to the corresponding e-mail address.

2. Login posibility:

If a picture gets likes and/or comments, the user will get a notification email. If the user prefers not to get notified, they have the possibility to deactivate the notifications in the settings page.
