<video> element
- The <video> HTML element embeds a media player which supports video playback into the document. You can use <video> for audio content as well, but the <audio> element may provide a more appropriate user experience.

- autoplay
-- A Boolean attribute; if specified, the video automatically begins to play back as soon as it can do so without stopping to finish loading the data.

- muted
-- Boolean attribute to mute video audio by default.
-- In some browsers (e.g. Chrome 70.0) autoplay doesn't work if no muted attribute is present.
