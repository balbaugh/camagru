<video> element

- autoplay
-- A Boolean attribute; if specified, the video automatically begins to play back as soon as it can do so without stopping to finish loading the data.

- muted
-- Boolean attribute to mute video audio by default.
-- In some browsers (e.g. Chrome 70.0) autoplay doesn't work if no muted attribute is present.
